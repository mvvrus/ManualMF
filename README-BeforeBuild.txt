Attention!

To make the successful build of the project ManualMFAdapter (and the overall solution) possible,
copy a Microsoft.IdentityServer.Web.dll assembly from your AD FS directory (typically C:\Windows\ADFS)
on your Windows Server with AD FS role installed to the project's targed binary files directory 
(ManualMFAdapter\bin\Debug and/or ManualMFAdapter\bin\Release) before performing a build.

This assembly is not included in the repository, because I have no right to distribute it.
